/// means that the hole `x` is free in `b` and should be substituted for `y`.
/// This syntax is similar to lambda binder syntax `Î»x: A. b`, which is
/// `(x: A) => b` in Hash notation.
///
/// A hole binder is created to denote the type of a hole in the inner term, and
/// is turned into a guess binding if a tactic tries to fill the hole. Once all
/// hole bindings are converted into guess bindings and the resultant term
/// type-checks, the guesses are substituted in for the holes in the inner term.
