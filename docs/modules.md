# Hash language modules

## General
`Hash` has a fairly robust module system that allows one to split a codebase
into smaller fragments.

Modules allow for a source to be split up into smaller code fragments, allowing for better source code organisation and maintainance. Many guides online
suggest that a project should have source files of between 500-1000 lines of code,
but it's really up to the developer about how long their modules should be, and in
general how a project source is organised.

A module in `Hash` is equivalent to a namespace that can contain variable definitions, function definitions, type definitions or include other modules.

## Importing

Given the project structure:
```
.
+-- lib
|   +-- a.hash
|   +-- b.hash
|   +-- sub
|   |   +-- c.hash
+-- main.hash
```

Modules in hash allow for a source to be split up into smaller code fragments, allowing for better source code organisation and maintainance.

You can import modules by specifying the path relative to the current path. 

For example, if you wanted to include the modules `a`, `b`, and or `c` within your main file

```rust
// main.hash
let a = import("lib/a");
let b = import("lib/b");
let c = import("lib/sub/c");
```

By doing so, you are placing everything that is defined within each of those modules under
the namespace. 

## Referencing exports

Furthermore, if the `a` module contained a structure definition like `Point`:

```rust
// a.hash
struct Point = {
    x: u32;
    y: u32;
}
```

Within main, you can create a new `point` by doing the following

```rust
// main.hash
let a = import("lib/a");

let p1 = a::Point { x=2; y=3 };

print(p1.x); // 2
print(p1.y); // 3
```

So from this example, you use the `::` (namespace access operator) to reference any exports from the module.

Furthermore, what if you wanted to import only a specific definition within a module such as the 'Point' structure from the module `a`.

You can do so by destructuring the definitions into using the syntax as
follows:

```rust
let {Point} = import("lib/a");

let p1 = Point { x=2; y=3 };
```

In case you have a member of your current module already reserving a name, you
can rename the exported members to your liking:
```rust
let {Point: LibPoint} = import("lib/a");

let p1 = LibPoint { x=2; y=3 };
```

**Note**: Naming is entirely up to the developer, there are no restrictions on naming
except the language naming

## Limitations

### Cyclic imports

Hash does not currently support cyclical dependencies within a project. Two modules within a project cannot be dependent on each other. As much as this might be an inconvienience, this is done to avoid "behaviour" which is implied by supporting cyclical imports. Other languages such as JavaScript support cyclical imports but can sometimes exhibit strange behaviour when using modules with cyclical imports.

It is currently under consideration to lift this restriction, but at the same time avoid strange behaviours when supporting cyclical imports.

If you attempt to run a module which has a cyclical import, the compiler will error and refuse to run the module like so:

```sh
$ hash -e ./module_with_cyclic_imports.hash
error: Found circular dependency in "./module_with_cyclic_imports.hash"
```
